# Airlines-Delay-Prediction-project

Description:
The Airlines Delay Prediction Project is a data science initiative aimed at developing a predictive model to forecast flight delays for airline departures. Flight delays are a common concern for both airlines and passengers, causing inconvenience, financial losses, and disruptions to travel plans. By leveraging historical flight data, weather information, and other relevant factors, this project seeks to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of flight delays.
